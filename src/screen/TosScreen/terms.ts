### General (including mandatory arbitration)
Entire agreement: These terms of use constitute the entire agreement between you and Holepunch Inc. and supersede any prior agreements between you and Holepunch Inc. You may also be subject to additional terms of service that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software.

Governing Law: These Terms shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands and shall be interpreted in all respects as a BVI contract. Any transaction, dispute, controversy, claim or action arising from or related to your access or use of our Site or our Products or these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, exclusive of choice-of-law principles.

Mandatory Arbitration: Except for excluded claims described below, you and we each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of our Site or our Products at any time, will be subject to and finally resolved by confidential, binding arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. If you are subject to the laws of the United States of America, the interpretation and enforceability of this arbitration provision will be governed by the

Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 _et seq_. Arbitration will be conducted through the use of videoconferencing technology (unless both arbitration parties agree that an in-person hearing is appropriate given the nature of the dispute) before a single arbitrator in accordance with the British Virgin Islands International Arbitration Centre Arbitration Rules, as amended from time to time (the “BVI IAC Rules”). The arbitrator selected by the arbitration parties must be a licenced attorney in the British Virgin Islands with at least fifteen (15) years of experience in commercial disputes. If the arbitration parties do not jointly appoint the arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the arbitration, any vacancies will be filled by an arbitrator meeting the above qualifications selected by the British Virgin Islands Arbitration Centre in accordance with the BVI IAC Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. If the arbitral parties do not promptly agree to the seat of arbitration if an in-person hearing is selected, the seat will be the British Virgin Islands. The language of the arbitral proceedings will be English. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be enforced in court. For claims less than $15,000, we will reimburse you for all initiating filing fees. Should you be deemed the losing party, the filing fees reimbursed by us will be added to the final arbitrator’s costs and fees award. The prevailing party will be entitled to its costs of the arbitration (including the arbitrator’s fees) and its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

The following claims and causes of action will be excluded from arbitration as described in the paragraphs above: causes of action or claims in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of its intellectual property, including without limitation copyrights, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, or patents or its confidential information or private data. Parties shall be at liberty to pursue claims or causes of actions excluded from arbitration through the courts of competent jurisdiction.

The arbitrator will have the power to hear and determine challenges to its jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement. This authority extends to jurisdictional challenges with respect to both the subject matter of the dispute and the parties to the arbitration. Further, the arbitrator will have the power to determine the existence, validity, or scope of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the purposes of challenges to the arbitrator's jurisdiction, each clause within this section will be considered separable from any contract of which it forms a part. Any challenges to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, except challenges based on the award itself, will be made not later than the notice of defense or, with respect to a counterclaim, the reply to the counterclaim; provided, however, that if a claim or counterclaim is later added or amended such a challenge may be made not later than the response to such claim or counterclaim as provided under BVI IAC Rules.

You and we expressly intend and agree that: (a) class action and representative action procedures are hereby waived and will not be asserted, nor will they apply, in any arbitration pursuant to these Terms; (b) neither you nor we will assert class action or representative action claims against the other in arbitration or otherwise; (c) each of you and us will only submit our own, individual claims in arbitration and will not seek to represent the interests of any other person, or consolidate claims with any other person; (d) nothing in these Terms will be interpreted as your or our intent to arbitrate claims on a class or representative basis; and (e) any relief awarded to any one user of our Site or Products cannot and may not affect any other user. No adjudicator may consolidate or join more than one person’s claims and or otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.

You, we and any other arbitration parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

JURY TRIAL WAIVER: TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR ANY BREACH THEREOF, ANY USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF OUR SITE OR OUR PRODUCTS BY YOU, AND/OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING YOU AND US.

Severability: If an adjudicator of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be (or are otherwise) invalid, you nevertheless agree that the adjudicator should endeavour to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these terms shall remain in full force and effect.

Waiver: If you breach these terms and we choose to ignore your breach, we shall still be entitled to use our rights and remedies at a later date or in any other circumstances where you breach these terms again.
